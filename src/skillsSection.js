        "Messenger bottles is an application that is so close to my heart, it took me 3 months to build this and still scope of improvement is there. Basically, this application is a clone of slack where one can log in to the application with google, then join different channels or create a new channel if likes to. In the case of so many channels, you can search for a specific channel in the search bar. For better readability of text, I provided a random background colour so that one can easily differentiate. Still working and improving this application, thank you. üòä",
