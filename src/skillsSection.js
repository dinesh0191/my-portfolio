        "The magic blog is an application where one can add and read blogs. In this application, I used useState, useEffect, useParams, useHistory etc. First time used styled-components and it's an amazing experience with them, they are easy to handle and easy to allocate the design. Recently noticed that in my other projects if someone adds some random text with the required URL there is nothing on the screen except the navbar. This project fixed that issue. And it is great learning for me to improve myself in the path of front-end development.",
